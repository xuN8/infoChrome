			<h2>My Coding Journey: The Last Five Years</h2>

			<h3>Codecademy Javascript</h3>
			<p>			
				The first language I learned was Javascript.  I had no idea what it was or what it was used for, but I loved it.  Practiced on and off since I didn't know how to apply it outside of Codecademy.
			</p>

			<h3>Arduino C++</h3>
			<p>
				CodingWithKids summer camp at AWS Elemental.  Learned about hardware components and how to program Arduino boards.  Made a robot with remote control, self driving, and line tracking functionality.
			</p>

			<h3>Code.org</h3>
			<p>
				Introduced to block coding at school.  Code.org has little puzzle problems for learning coding fundamentals, but at this point it was mostly review.
			</p>

			<h3>Scratch</h3>
			<p>
				Another block-based app from school, but this one is more of an open sandbox.  Made some pretty crazy projects on there outside of class.
			</p>

			<h3>MIT App Inventor</h3>
			<p>
				Probably my least favorite block coding app, but it was still fun to use.  Everything was asynchronus and event-based, which felt a little limiting sometimes.
			</p>

			<h3>Codecademy HTML/CSS/JS</h3>
			<p>
				Finally tried my hand at web development.  I found HTML very easy to learn, and made a simple website within a few days of learning.  This was around the time ChromeOS Linux came out, so I used VScode for this.
			</p>

			<h3>Codecademy Python 2</h3>
			<p>
				Had to learn Python eventually.  It was so different from Javascript I was gawking at how clean the syntax was.
			</p>

			<h3>Discord Bot Python</h3>
			<p>
				Because why not?  Finally got a proper PC after developing on a Chromebook for three years, you bet I was ready(Heroku wasn't downloading properly on Chrome Linux).  Asynchronus programming.  Modules.  HTTP requests.  Web scraping.  *cough* *cough* API request limits.  Boy that was a lot.  At least my bot can get weather, news, and nutrition facts now...
			</p>

			<h3>Roblox Lua</h3>
			<p>
				Here we go, spent an entire year just on this.  This was another thing the my Chromebook stopped me from doing sooner -_-.  Well, time to make Roblox games!  Right off the bat I had to do something hard. I'm looking at you, RocketLab.  Planet gravity, rocket builder, rocket stats, rocket controls, rocket UI, stage deploy, astronaut suits...I gave up.  I was working on this thing literally the entire day for months.  Drained, tired, hopless.
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, time to do something super easy, a Roblox tycoon!  Yay!  Let's overthink the mechanics, reinvent the wheel, and add ridiculously ambitous features to it!  <small>yay?</small>  Well, at least it's coming together now.
			</p>

			<h3>Qubit by Qubit Python</h3>
			<p>
				Did I hear quantum computing?  What's that?  Another rabbit hole I should fall into?  Ok, let's do it.  Learned a bunch of college level math, quantum mechanics, IBM Qiskit library on Python, donwloaded a bunch of stuff I probably won't use ever again...Yeah, that was fun :)
			</p>

			<h3>Sololearn Python 3</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Pssst.</em> What? <em>About time you learned Python 3.</em> *Sigh* ok...
			
			<h3>CodeHS</h3>
			<p>Let's learn Python 3 again, with tRaCy tHe TuRTle. Um, fine, I guess...</p>
			
			<h3>HTML/CSS/JS (again)</h3>
			<p>		
				<em>Psssssssssst.</em> What now? <em>Your HTML is rUsTY.</em> Go away, no one asked you >:(
