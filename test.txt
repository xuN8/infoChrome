How to connect repo:
	git init
	git remote add origin https://github.com/xuN8/xuN8.github.io.git
	git push -u origin master (add "--force" at the end is it's acting up)
	enter credentials

Pushing changes:
	git add .
	git commit -m "Commit message here"
	git push
	enter credentials

Other:
	git status				- shows you what files have been modified
	type nul > test.txt		- creates a text file
