                    <p>One of my absolute favorites because it's so fun and engaging!  Scratch is a nice online resource which does a very good job at teaching the fundamentals of code.  Unlike many websites, it's much more self-guided, allowing you to just <em>code</em>.  After all, the only way to learn it is to do it.

                <div class = "codeorg">
                    <h2><a href = "code.org">Code.org</a></h2>
                    <p>While this isn't the best resource in my opinion, Code.org does help establish good habits and solidifies the fundamentals.  It's more tutorial-based, giving you progressively more difficult challenges as you go.  However, the progression can be a little choppy, so it may be a bit dicouraging for beginners.</p>

                    <p>Getting comfortable with coding?  Let's kick it up a notch!  Codecademy is a great way to start learning about text-based code.  It has courses for many popular languages, each with fun, interactive excersizes.  I find this website to be pretty useful alongside building your own projects.  
                        For example, codecademy is great for learning html, but it's also a good idea to try applying html into a project.  With that said, let's get ready for that in <a href = "setup.html">setup</a>!</p>
